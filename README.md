## Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis
This is an end-to-end data analysis project where we take a spreadsheet full of information about a hospital emergency room and try to extract useful insights from that organized data. We have used Microsoft Excel as our primary tool.
#Data Given
We begin with having the data spreadsheet undortood first and then take a look at our KPIs that we are going to extract out of it. There are data available like 
1. how many patients are getting admitted each day
2. how much each of them had to wait to be assigned to a medical professional
3. how the satisfaction score (from 0-10) did each patient gave before being released
4. What are the personal information about them and where are they getting refered to and many more.
#Cleaning & Transformation
Power Query Editor: We first take out the raw CSV file data in our Excel and before loading, we do some transformations on the existing columns using this editor
